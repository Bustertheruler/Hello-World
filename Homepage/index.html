<h1>Hello World</h1>
<img src="myself.gif" alt= "me">
<p>My name is Hyder Baig</p>
<p>How's it going everyone, this is my second year at chaffey and I've been into web development for over a year and I have enjoyed it. 
I like the feeling of creating something of my own which is why I chose this path. I kind of overdid it for this assignment but I'm trying to get a little 
refresh on my HTML since it's been a while since I've used it. </p>
